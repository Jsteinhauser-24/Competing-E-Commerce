## DESCRIPTION
It is the backend of an Ecommerce webpage. I used http routes, models, and seeds in order to create and interact with the database created with mysql.
## INSTALLATION
One would need to recreate the database using mysql 2, run the npm seed, and start the application with node. Once that is all done then you can use the http routes in Insomnia to interact with the data.
## USAGE
Through Insomnia
